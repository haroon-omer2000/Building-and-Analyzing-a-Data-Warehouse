# Building-and-Analyzing-a-Data-Warehouse
This project extracts operational data from databases through the incoming stream, transforms it in a format suitable to be loaded in a data warehouse, and loads it into the warehouse using an efficient join algorithm called MESHJOIN. Several OLAP queries are executed to find out answers to several business oriented problems.
